# üîê Brute Force Custom HTTP Header

Brute force simulation of custom HTTP headers ‚Äî useful for API security education and token-based security testing. Great for understanding the risks when developers store authentication in headers without strict validation.

## Description

This simulation targets custom headers such as: X-Device-ID: device-xxxxxx

The goal of this script is to guess the combination `xxxxxx` using brute force method.
For this example I use the combination `a1b2c3`.

---

## Educational Goals

- Recognize the risks of using headers as the sole authentication.
- Understand the importance of entropy and token length.
- Learn the basics of brute force & token combination exploration.
  
---

## Customizable parameters

- `TARGET_HEADER`
Header value to guess
- `charset`
Characters used, for a-z use string.ascii_lowercase and for 0-9 use string.digits
- `length`
Target token length (default 6)
- `sleep()`
Can be added for delay simulation but here I don't use it

---

## Contoh Penggunaan
- Open the file in visual studio code or another code editor
- Open terminal
- Run
```
python week2_sesi3.py
```

### Example of combination a1b2c3:
![Hasil](https://github.com/Aaronabil/header-brute-force-simulator/blob/main/hasil.jpg?raw=true)
- Here I did 45,432,678 trials and it took 2578 seconds or the equivalent of 42 minutes.

---

## Development Potential
- Interactive CLI (target input, charset, token length)
- Multi-threaded brute force (faster)
- Local server simulation for end-to-end testing

---

## Closing
- Brute force headers are an example of how a small mistake in authentication design can have a big impact. Learn, test, and use this knowledge ethically.
